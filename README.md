# Bandcamp Streamer
Browser extension for Chrome & Firefox developed by A Flow of Code. Special acknowledgement to [lovethebomb](https://github.com/lovethebomb/) for the initial feed player class.

Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bandcamp-streamer/hopclencgmfjiipjmlenfcdgcdblfmjh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bandcamp-streamer/hopclencgmfjiipjmlenfcdgcdblfmjh)

Firefox: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bandcamp-streamer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bandcamp-streamer/)

### Stream uninterrupted from various bandcamp pages
  * Feed
  * Personal collection / wishlist
  * Any other fan's collection / wishlist
      
### Feed page features 
  * Nonstop streaming from 2 separate playlists: fan activity or new releases
  * Price listed next to "buy now"
  * Volume control
  
### Personal (owned) collection page features
  * Stream full albums continuously (moves onto next album after finishing) 
  * Stream a playlist of your favorite track from each release (plays first track from album if favorite not set)
  * Shuffle either album or favorites playlist 

### Known issues
  * New stories added from the top while the feed page is loaded are not added to the playlist. If you want to hear them, just reload the page.

### Building the package
 * If you want to build and load the browser extension yourself, rename the manifest file for the browser of your choice to manifest.json and follow the browser's instructions for loading a developer extension. On Windows you could also use something like this script I wrote to [automatically create uploadable zip packages for browser extensions written for both Firefox and Chrome](https://gist.github.com/AFlowOfCode/6704a5d56f58a016c8f3205f2c18e4e8).
