# Bandcamp Feed Playlist

This is a lazy Chrome Extension that adds a mini player on  the [bandcamp feed](http://www.bandcamp.com) page.

It allows you to quickly Play/Pause, go back and forth, and support autoplay of the tracks shared on your feed.

I was just tired of clicking every cover to check out what it was.

## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:lovethebomb/bandcamp-feed-playlist.git
```

Clone the repo and simply load the folder into Chrome as an unpacked extension, as described in the [Getting Started Tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest)1.
