				<h3>Updates in v1.6.0 (August 2024)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Welcome page</li>
					<li>Reverse playlist function</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Comments, suggestions, and any other feedback is welcome! Submit bugs & feature requests on <a href="http://www.github.com/aflowofcode/bandcamp-streamer/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or email <strong class="email">aflowofcode [at] gmail [dot] com</strong>.

					<summary>Potential feature (wish)list</summary>
					<ul>
						<li>Custom playlists with export/backup ability</li>
						<li>Search by tag (generate tag-based playlists)</li>
						<li>Generate playlists based on collection rarity (i.e. your items that appear in <= 50 total collections, >= 1000, etc)</li>
						<li>Stats / collection analysis (tag/rarity percentages, etc, suggestions?) for both your & others' collections</li>
						<li>Enable streaming on the official Discover & Tag pages</li>
						<li>Your suggestion!</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Many features are non-trivial to implement, so I'm considering adding a paid tier which unlocks advanced features such as those listed above. It's a fact that almost nobody views browser extensions as something to be paid for, but it takes a lot of time and effort to work on them nonetheless. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you'd be willing to make a one-time donation or pay a low monthly subscription fee for special access, please let me know along with what feature you'd most like to see!

				<h3>Supporter links:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://pinkabductionray.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Pink Abduction Ray</a></li>

					<summary>Have a link to share?</summary>
					<p>This extension has a user base of over 1500 Bandcamp power users who are deeply interested in music and active on a daily basis.</p>
					<p>Supporters donating >= $10 can optionally add a link to this list as a thank you for stimulating the maintenance & development of excellent features that will make your music experience better üíô</p> 
					<p>Acceptable links: Bandcamp music or fan pages, DJ mix pages, radio shows, or other music-specific sites such as band/producer websites, collectives, labels, etc.</p>
					<p>Send donations to <a href="https://www.paypal.me/aflowofcode">https://www.paypal.me/aflowofcode</a> with your desired link (& emoji!) in the note section, or send an email with any questions!</p>

				<h3>5 year anniversary compilation!</h3>
				<p>
					Since this extension is all about music discovery, I thought it would be cool to curate a compilation of users' music to celebrate its 5 year anniversary in October. I know lots of you are musicians, so what do you say? 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have music on Bandcamp, send links for up to 3 tracks to choose from to <strong class="email">aflowofcode [at] gmail [dot] com</strong>. All styles welcome as long as the music is yours!
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Deadline: September 30, 2024.</strong>
				</p>
				<p> 
					If there's enough interest & participation, I'll make a free compilation and embed it in this very page!
